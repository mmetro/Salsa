suicide car bomb kills at pakistan volleyball game
peshawar pakistan jan afp
suicide car bomber killed at least people on friday after targeting crowd
gathered for volleyball game in northwest pakistan village in the deadliest
strike in more than two months
the latest bombing marked bloody start to for pakistan which has seen
surge in attacks blamed on taliban in recent months as islamist fighters avenge
military operations aimed at crushing their northwest strongholds
britain immediately condemned the attack as horrific and vowed to work with
islamabad to tackle the threat posed by violent extremism
man detonated his vehicle which was packed with explosives as fans gathered
at field to watch two local teams face off at volleyball tournament in the
village of shah hasan khan in bannu district which borders the taliban
stronghold south waziristan
the villagers were watching the match between the two village teams when the
bomber rashly drove his double cabin pick up vehicle into them and blew it up
district police chief mohammad ayub khan told afp
at least people have died in the suicide bombing and the toll is likely to
rise khan said he earlier said that more than were wounded
khan said that the tournament was organised by the local peace committee who
had supported government operation to expel militants from the area
it was the highest death toll from suspected militant strike since massive
car bomb on october killed people in crowded market in the northwestern
provincial capital peshawar
khan said that more than houses on both sides of the open ground where the
match was being played had collapsed
four paramilitary soldiers are also among the dead he added
ramzan bittani year old driver told afp by telephone from local
hospital that he had left the match to take call
as was listening saw huge blue and white spark followed by an ear
piercing blast when was able to figure out what had happened saw bodies
and smoke all around my hand was fractured he said
anwer khan student said that he had just stepped out of his house and he
saw black pick up speeding up towards the spectators
giant flame leaped towards the sky there was bright light everywhere just
like flash and then very huge blast shook everything two pellets hit my
forehead and blood started flowing khan said
district police chief khan said that women and children were pulled from the
rubble of nearby house that collapsed in the blast and said that the remote
area was struggling to cope with the scale of the attack
he blamed the bomb on islamist extremists who were the target of military
operation in bannu district last year
security has plummeted over the last two and half years in pakistan where
militant violence has killed more than people since july
the northwest has suffered the brunt of the militant campaign with suicide
bombings increasingly targeting civilians
the military is now locked in its most ambitious assault yet on taliban
strongholds in south waziristan sending troops into battle in the
district on the afghan border on october
washington however is urging pakistan to do more to also stamp out al qaeda
sanctuaries and dismantle havens of militants who cross the border and attack us
and nato troops stationed in afghanistan
on friday in north waziristan district missiles fired from us drone air craft
killed three suspected militants kilometres nine miles east of miranshah
the main district town close to the afghan border

britain to hold talks on fighting extremism in yemen
london jan afp
british prime minister gordon brown called an international meeting friday on
combating extremism in yemen after an alleged attempt to blow up us airliner
threw the spotlight on militancy there
brown office said the meeting would take place in london on january
running in parallel with conference on afghanistan which is expected to be
attended by senior ministers or leaders from about nations
long standing concerns that yemen has become haven for islamic terror groups
were thrown into sharp relief when nigerian man allegedly trained in the gulf
state was charged with trying to blow up us airliner on december
umar farouk abdulmutallab reportedly confessed to being trained by an al
qaeda bombmaker in yemen for his alleged mission to blow up the plane as it came
into land in detroit sparking major international security scare
the united states revealed this week that it was sharply increasing its military
and economic aid to the gulf state to fight growing threat from al qaeda and
brown said it was vital to mobilise international support
the international community must not deny yemen the support it needs to tackle
extremism the british prime minister said
he has invited key international partners to high level meeting in order to
discuss how best to counter radicalisation in yemen brown office said
the aims of the london meeting would include identifying what the yemeni
government needs to help it fight violent islamic extremism and coordinating
assistance for areas most at risk of becoming radical it said in statement
the attempted attack on the us plane renewed long held concerns that yemen the
poorest arab country is base for violent extremism
according to the washington post and the new york times electronic
communications intercepted from yemen by the national security agency had warned
that an unidentified nigerian was training for an al qaeda mission
meanwhile al qaeda in the arabian peninsula aqap has claimed it was behind the
plot us officials have refused to confirm this but said there was some
linkage with al qaeda
the united states has been helping yemen to train and equip its forces since
and officials say its contribution is expected to rise to million
dollars in development and security assistance in the fiscal year
both countries are sharing intelligence and the united states is widely
suspected of having helped yemeni forces conduct airstrikes against al qaeda
targets in the past few weeks
yemeni raids in the centre of the country and the sanaa region last month killed
more than islamist militants while several rebels were also wounded in
clashes this week
yemen president ali abdullah saleh appealed in his new year message friday
to young people not to be fooled by elements of al qaeda saying it is time
to lower weapons and renounce violence and terrorism
in his new year message brown said the detroit incident showed that terrorism
remained very real global threat as the world enters new decade eight
years after the september attacks on the united states
enemies of democracy and freedom now trying to mastermind death and
destruction from yemen as well as other better known homes of international
terror such as pakistan and afghanistan are concealing explosives in ways
which are more difficult to detect he wrote in an article on his website
al qaeda and their associates continue in their ambition to indoctrinate
thousands of young people around the world with deadly desire to kill and

briton freed after iraq kidnap ordeal arrives home
london jan afp
briton freed this week after being kidnapped in iraq in flew home friday
for reunion with his family officials said as controversy over his ordeal
refused to die down
peter moore computer expert was released unharmed wednesday after two
and half years captivity during which all four of his bodyguards also
britons are thought to have been killed
the year old flight touched down at the royal air force raf base at brize
norton in oxfordshire northwest of london shortly after pm gmt
spokesman for the foreign office in london said
moore was met by officials before boarding people carrier to be reunited with
his family off base
his father graeme moore said he was absolutely delighted at his return
saying want to give him big hug when see him me and his friends can
wait to see him and it just massive relief to get him home
moore step parents fran and pauline sweeney appealed for privacy
we are thrilled to have peter back safely we have lot of catching up to do
and would like to have time with peter on our own they said
moore is reportedly going to be sent to safe house for assessments by doctors
and psychiatrists and help in readjusting to normal life
relatives of moore and of the guards captured with him have meanwhile spoken of
their anger at the british government handling of the matter
the bodies of three bodyguards alec maclachlan jason swindlehurst
and jason creswell were handed over to british officials last year
fourth alan mcmenemy is also believed to be dead
mcmenemy father dennis accused the foreign office of deceit lies and cover
up while moore mother avril sweeney said the government had never told the
truth the guardian reported
the paper said thursday that iran revolutionary guard led the kidnap operation
and took the five to iran within day of their abduction
general david petraeus the us regional military commander reiterated to
reporters in baghdad friday that moore spent at the very least part of his
time in captivity in iran
that is based on an intelligence assessment and obviously ve not had chance
to hear it certainly not to talk to him but nor to hear anything that he has
said petraeus said
some commentators said deal may have been done to free moore after qais al
khazali leader of the group which captured the britons from government
building in baghdad was recently transferred from us to iraqi custody
graeme moore said he believed this is what had happened
about four weeks ago got tip that there had been secret meetings between
the kidnappers and the americans regarding al khazali he said without
revealing his source
couldn find out any more progress of the meetings as it was all being kept
hush hush the whole thing was kept very secret to stop the foreign office
messing it up
was told they were being kept out of the loop and knew nothing about it until
the kidnappers handed peter over to the iraqi authorities
but the foreign office denied any deal was done saying the united states
transferred al khazali into iraqi custody under the terms of bilateral status
of forces agreement
separately the government of iraq is carrying out process of reconciliation
with groups willing to renounce violence and enter the political mainstream it
said in statement
since holding hostages is incompatible with reconciliation we judge that
progress on the wider reconciliation effort will benefit hostages held in iraq
there has been no prisoner exchange deal in the case of peter moore
britain and iran have also played down reports of link to iran
